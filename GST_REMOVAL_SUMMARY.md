total = subtotal + shipping - discount
      = (No GST)
```

### Example Calculation

**Cart with ‚Çπ3000 worth of products:**

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Subtotal | ‚Çπ3,000 | ‚Çπ3,000 |
| GST (12%) | ‚Çπ360 | ‚Çπ0 |
| Shipping | ‚Çπ0 | ‚Çπ0 |
| Discount | ‚Çπ0 | ‚Çπ0 |
| **Total** | **‚Çπ3,360** | **‚Çπ3,000** |

**Cart with ‚Çπ1,500 worth of products:**

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Subtotal | ‚Çπ1,500 | ‚Çπ1,500 |
| GST (12%) | ‚Çπ180 | ‚Çπ0 |
| Shipping | ‚Çπ99 | ‚Çπ99 |
| Discount | ‚Çπ0 | ‚Çπ0 |

```javascript
{
  subtotal: Number,

  shipping_cost: Number,
  discount_amount: Number,
  total_amount: Number     // subtotal + shipping - discount
}
```

### Order Model
```javascript

  subtotal: Number,
  tax_amount: Number,      // Now always 0
